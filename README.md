## About The Project

This application uses machine learning to predict when games will be added to major subscription services. Instead of manually tracking when your favorite games become free, this tool analyzes historical data and provides accurate predictions with confidence scores.

## Backend Architecture

### GameServicePredictor Class - ML Engine

The backend uses a tiered prediction system with three fallback layers.

#### Tier 1: Historical Lookup (Most Reliable)

If a game previously appeared on the platform, the system calculates when it might return based on average intervals between appearances. This uses Pandas to analyze historical data from CSV files.

#### Tier 2: XGBoost Model

For new games, an XGBoost machine learning model predicts time-to-service using features like:
- Publisher identity (encoded)
- Metacritic score
- Publisher statistics (average days to inclusion, consistency variance)

#### Tier 3: First-Party Check

Microsoft and Sony first-party titles are handled with special logic:
- Xbox Game Pass: 99% confidence prediction of "Day One" release
- PlayStation Studios: 75% confidence for "within 12-24 months"

### Confidence Scoring

Predictions include confidence percentages calculated based on:
- Sample Size Reliability
- Data Consistency
- Metacritic Availability

Platform-specific caps:
- Epic Games: 95% maximum confidence
- Xbox Game Pass: 80% maximum confidence
- PS Plus Extra: 70% maximum confidence

## Data Flow

1. User searches for a game
2. Frontend queries RAWG API for game metadata
3. User selects a game and chooses a subscription platform
4. Frontend sends game details and platform choice to Flask backend
5. Backend's GameServicePredictor runs the tiered prediction logic
6. Backend returns prediction with category, confidence, and reasoning
